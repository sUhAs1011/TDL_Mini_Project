### AI BASED LAW-PREDICTOR
The AI-Powered Case Law Predictor is a deep learning-based system designed to predict legal case outcomes based on past rulings. We can train the model on historical case documents, and based on it the model can helping predicting the verdict. We can train the model to processes legal text, extracting key legal arguments, precedents, and patterns in judicial decisions, by using natural language processing (NLP) and sequence classification, this system can assist lawyers, judges, and researchers in assessing case probabilities, understanding influential legal factors, and even conducting counterfactual analysisâ€”evaluating how different evidence might change the verdict.
